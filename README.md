# Google-Homepage

# http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css?ref=lnav

This project from the Odin Project curriculum was centered around learning HTML and CSS basics. The goal was to recreate the Google Homepage from scratch. This was my first ever web design project and was eye opening as it showed me what building something from scratch with code is like. 

Although the project was difficult it also helped me learn a lot and provided me with great satisfaction once complete. It also made me realize that I can learn to code and more importantly that I enjoy it and find the challenge fun.
